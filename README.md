# INK2MATH_smart_equation_solver
This project is based on solving maths equations and providing you with proper solved equations. It is based on deep knowledge of OCR engine, Machine learning, deep learning, Neural networks and several techniques. Used for students and teachers to find them in a good state if they are not able to solve any questions.
We have also used CROHME Dataset and MINIST Dataset for the project.
Applications:
1. Used for students and teachers in education field
2. Used by researchers to solve complex problems.
3. Also used by blind aided students with help of voice recognition system in it.
